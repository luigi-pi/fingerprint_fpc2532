# `fingerprint_fpc2532`

**ESPHome integration for the FPC2532 fingerprint sensor (ESP32)**
#### **This repository provides a custom ESPHome component for interfacing the FPC2532 fingerprint module, enabling secure and reliable fingerprint authentication for home-automation projects.**

## ⭐ Why another fingerprint sensor for ESPHome?

ESPHome already includes an official fingerprint component for the R503 (`fingerprint_grow`).
So why create another one?

### 🔐 **More secure**

The R503 stores fingerprint images *unencrypted* in its memory.
If someone removes the sensor, your fingerprint images are accessible in plain form — a potentially serious privacy/security risk.
The FPC2532 encrypts stored data.

### 🛡️ **No fingerprint image extraction**

With the R503 it's possible to extract and share fingerprint images (dangerous if the DIY solution has any security flaws).
The FPC2532 does **not** allow image extraction.

### 📘 **Proper documentation & reliability tests**

FPC2532 modules come with better documentation and real reliability testing.

### 🔋 **Much lower power consumption**

Ideal for battery-powered devices.**22 µA** in finger-detect mode.

### 🎮 **Gesture navigation**

The hardware allows simple up/down/left/right swipe navigation (future feature).

### ⚠️ Drawbacks

* More expensive
* No built-in LEDs
* Requires some integration work for enclosure mounting

## 🧩 Component Overview

The sensor communicates via UART (default `921600 baud`).
* Pin `CONFIG` (pin 1) must be tied HIGH (3.3 V, through a resistor, e.g. 24kOhm) for UART operation.
* Pin 3.3V (pin 10) must be tied to the 3.3V power supply (check datasheet for optional caps and TVS diodes).
* Pin Rx (pin 3) and Tx (pin 2) must be connected to ESP Tx and Rx (swapped: sensor Tx to ESP Rx and vice versa).
* Pin 11 and 12 must be connected to ESP32 GND.
* for optional pins see table below

### Optional pins

| Pin                  | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **sensor_power_pin** | Wakes up the sensor before sending a command. Requires `stop_mode_uart: true`. Recommended **not** to use because sensor consumes only **22 µA (0.7mW)**  in finger-detect mode. Connected to sys-WU (pin 8 of fpc sensor). To disable SYS-WU must be connected to 3.3V (through a resistor, e.g. 24kOhm) |
| **reset_pin**        | Hardware reset of the sensor. Pin 9 of the sensor. Connect the pin to an ESP32 GPIO with an external pull-up resistor (e.g. 22 kΩ) to 3.3 V.|
| **irq_pin**          | Wakes up the ESP32 when the sensor detects a finger. Useful for low-power designs (sleep mode not yet implemented, can be added via YAML).  Pin 4 of the sensor, to be connected to ESP32 RTC GPIO through a resistor e.g. 2.2kOhm (to avoid issues if set as output pin  by mistake )                                                |

## 🔐 Password & Unique ID Handling 

The FPC2532 requires a device password for all authenticated operations.
This password **must match the sensor’s internal unique hardware ID (unique_id)**.

### 🟦 Step 1 — Obtain the Unique ID

During the first installation, temporarily enable the `unique_id` text sensor in your YAML.
After flashing the device **without a password set**, go to Home Assistant:

```
Settings → Devices & Services → Devices → Select your fingerprint sensor → Sensor tab
```

There you will find the `unique_id` value. Write it down.

### 🟦 Step 2 — Set the Password

Add the detected ID to your YAML under your password (check above Base Configuration Variables)
Re-flash the device.
From now on, the sensor will authenticate correctly.

### 🛡️ Why this matters

The unique_id is permanently fused into the hardware.
Using it as the password ensures that:

* Only *this* exact sensor can authenticate with your ESP32
* Replacing the module with another FPC2532 will cause the password check to fail
* Fingerprint access cannot be spoofed by swapping hardware

## 🧪 Sample ESPHome YAML Configuration

> **Note:** GPIOXX placeholders must be replaced with actual pins.
Replace secrets accordingly.
This version includes LEDs, text sensors, API services, and all triggers. LEDs require a series resistor e.g. 100Ω or 220Ω for standard LEDs.
